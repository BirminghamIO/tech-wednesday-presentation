##  Women in Technology Meet Up

note:
    Birmingham.IO is also really good place for promoting your events, while allowing you to get feedback from attendees. A good example of this is the Women in Technology meet up which happened a couple of weeks ago, which I'm told had a far greater turn out than expected, due to it's promotion on the forum.
