##  Whisk App Beta Testing

note:
    I've also been working with Julie Yates of Whisk, who has been looking for people that can visit their office to beta test their app. Together we decided it would be a good idea to host an event one weekend, enticing people with the promice of pizza and games in exchange for their help. This is something which will not only will be promoted by the forum, but participants of the event will also gain a special badge on their community profile.
